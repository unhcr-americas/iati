<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->

```{r development, include=FALSE}
library(testthat)
```

<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.
--> 


# Show donors  - `show_donors`

<!--
Create a chunk for the core of the function

- The chunk needs to be named `function` at least
- It contains the code of a documented function
- The chunk can also be named `function-show_donors` to make it easily
findable in your Rmd
- Let the `@examples` part empty, and use the next `examples` chunk instead

After inflating the template

-  This function code will be added in a new file in the "R/" directory
-->

```{r function-show_donors}
#' Ploting Donors
#'
#' 
#' @param year year to select starting from 2016 - could be one year or a list
#' @param geo Region or Country or Site
#' @param sector Sectors
#' @param metric Metrics could be USD or Number of project
#' 
#' @inheritParams ggplot2::ggplot
#'
#' @return
#' Median of vector x
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
show_donors <- function(year, geo, sector, metric) {
  1
}
```

<!--
Create a chunk with an example of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `examples` at least
- It contains working examples of your function
- The chunk is better be named `examples-show_donors` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This example will be added in the '@examples' part of our function above in the "R/" directory
- This example will be added in the vignette created from this Rmd template
-->

```{r examples-show_donors}
show_donors(1:12)
```

<!--
Create a chunk with a test of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `tests` at least
- It contains working tests of your function
- The chunk is better be named `tests-show_donors` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This test code will be added in the "tests/testthat/" directory
-->

```{r tests-show_donors}
test_that("is_testing_possible", {

})
```

 
# Show implementers - `show_implementers`


```{r function-show_implementers}
#' show_implementers Title
#' @param year year to select starting from 2016 - could be one year or a list
#' @param geo Region or Country or Site
#' @param sector Sectors
#' @param metric Metrics could be USD or Number of project
#' 
#' @inheritParams ggplot2::ggplot
#' @return 1
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
show_implementers <- function(year, geo, sector, metric) {
  1
}
```

```{r examples-show_implementers}
show_implementers()
```

```{r tests-show_implementers}
test_that("show_implementers works", {

})
```





<!--
# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
-->


```{r developmenttest, include=FALSE}
library(testthat)
```

```{r development-1}
# Load already included functions
pkgload::load_all(export_all = FALSE)
```


```{r development-inflate, eval=FALSE}
# Inflate the package

# You're one inflate from paper to box.
# Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()`
# 
# - Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
# - Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
# - Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
# - Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory

# Keep eval=FALSE to avoid infinite loop in case you hit the knit button
# Execute in the console directly
fusen::inflate(flat_file = "dev/flat_full.Rmd", vignette_name = "Get started")
