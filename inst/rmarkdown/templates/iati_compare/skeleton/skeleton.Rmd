#  A "Strategic Moment of Reflection" ... 

 _"is  a dedicated moment for relevant stakeholders to review progress and identify challenges, opportunities and possible strategic shifts or re-orientations"_.

This presentation conveniently includes charts generated from [publicly released data (IATI)](https://reporting.unhcr.org/iati-international-aid-transparency-initiative).

The objective is to explore the relation between __Results__ measured through outcome indicators and __Resource Allocation__ measured through the share of total expenditure spent on a specific outcome. The resulting scatter-plot includes traffic light color bands to display some standard interpretation threshold for indicator value.

---

# How to interpret the charts? An attempt to look at "Value For Money"

Assuming programme effectiveness and attribution, a linear relation and __correlation__ should be observed between the money that was spent and the results that can be observed (_i.e most points should be aligned_).

If not, there can be various ways to interpret the situation:

 1. __Data Quality__: there might be glitches in the data...
 
 2. __Counterfactual__: Some evidence can be provided that without the existing level of resource, the situation would quickly deteriorate. In that sense, resource are not provided to improve the situation but rather to prevent critical situations.
 
 3. __Effectiveness__: No evidence can be made about the effectiveness of allocated resource to yield results.
