<!-- This vignette is generated by fusen: do not edit by hand -->

<!-- Run this 'development' chunk -->
<!-- Store every call to library() that you need to explore your functions -->


<!--
 You need to run the 'description' chunk in the '0-dev_history.Rmd' file before continuing your code there.

If it is the first time you use {fusen}, after 'description', you can directly run the last chunk of the present file with inflate() inside.

# Show donors  - `show_donors`

<!--
Create a chunk for the core of the function

- The chunk needs to be named `function` at least
- It contains the code of a documented function
- The chunk can also be named `function-show_donors` to make it easily
findable in your Rmd
- Let the `@examples` part empty, and use the next `examples` chunk instead

After inflating the template

-  This function code will be added in a new file in the "R/" directory
-->


<!--
Create a chunk with an example of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `examples` at least
- It contains working examples of your function
- The chunk is better be named `examples-show_donors` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This example will be added in the '@examples' part of our function above in the "R/" directory
- This example will be added in the vignette created from this Rmd template
-->


```{r examples-show_donors, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
show_donors(year = 2020,
            geo = "The Americas",
            transtype = "11" )
# ,  ## "3"  "4"  "11"           metric = "USD"
```

<!--
Create a chunk with a test of use for your function

- The chunk needs to be named `tests` at least
- It contains working tests of your function
- The chunk is better be named `tests-show_donors` to be handled
correctly when inflated as a vignette

After inflating the template

-  This test code will be added in the "tests/testthat/" directory


 tests-show_donors,echo=FALSE,  message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# test_that("is_testing_possible", {

# 

# })

```-->



 


# Show implementers  - `show_implementers`

 

```{r examples-show_implementers, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
show_implementers(year = 2020,
            geo = "The Americas",
            transtype = "11" ) 
```

<!--

# There can be development actions

Create a chunk with 'development' actions

- The chunk needs to be named `development` or `dev`
- It contains functions that are used for package development only
- Note that you may want to store most of these functions in the 0-dev_history.Rmd file

These are only included in the present flat template file, their content will not be part of the package anywhere else.
